A little about me: 
I am taking this class to get a better grasp on coding. I have not used coding since taking a required class in 2006 during my undergrad years. I do not remember much!
I received a BS in Mathematics in 2008 and MA in Education in 2011. I am currently in my 15th year as a Middle School Teacher. I am also serving as my school's Athletic Director this year.
In my free time, I like to drink coffee, watch my niece and nephews play softball and baseball, hangout with my small group at church, and run.
I'm looking forward to learning Python this semester!
